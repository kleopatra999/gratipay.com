    When matching paths Aspen looks for /%foo/ and then foo is a variable with
    the value in the URL path, so /bar/ would end up with `foo='bar'`.

    There's a dictionary at `website.typecasters` that maps variable names to
    functions, dependency-injectable as with `website.algorithm` [state-chain]
    functions. If an entry exists in `typecasters` for a given path variable,
    then the result of `path[part]` is replaced with the result of calling the
    function.

    Before calling your cast function, we add an additional value to the state
    dict under `path_part`, the URL path part that matched, as a string. That
    is user input so handle it carefully. It's your job to raise Response(400)
    if it's bad input.
